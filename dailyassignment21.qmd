## The STL decomposition shows three main patterns in the streamflow data. The trend shows a slow increase in flow from 2013 to 2015, followed by a decline through 2020, and a slight rise again after that. The seasonal component shows a strong and consistent annual cycle, with peaks in late spring or early summer probably caused by snowmelt. Lastly, the remainder shows short-term fluctuations not explained by trend or seasonalityâ€”maybe from storms, droughts, or water management events.
